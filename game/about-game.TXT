This game is a Single player game a little bit like ping pong game we used to play in our childhood.
I used to play this game a lot as It was an In-built game in Samsung Tv at that time. And I've not named this game so far...
so lets call it "SAMSUNG TV WALA GAME". This game is built with python Kivy which allows it to run on Desktop as well as Android with same codes.
For Android , All you have to do is to just convert this .py file to .apk with some linux commands.

CONTROLS:
	This game is controled with your mouse or you can use your Mobile Screen while playing it on Android.
HOW TO PLAY :
	Even a pro gamer is a noobda when it comes to play a new game he've not played yet. Well , His noobness could turn into some sort of average gaming
	if he gets to know how that particular game is played. So Lets go and jump into the playing section:-
	So the game starts with 3 moving balls and a solid block interface. All you have to do is to dont let any of the three balls touch wall on your
	 side by moving that block. And there will be  your score running at the top-right corner.The game auto closes when you fail to do so.
	Now,I know,  I know Everyone must be thining , What is this game...How can we play this game for too long..keeping eye on three balls is not an easy task, 
	well,  for your fun and to let you play for longer time...There are 10 lives i.e, if  failed to keep ball clear of your wall you still have 9 more chances
	to do so and to turn your score in a gient score.
	So give it a try...Have Fun..


----Any suggestion or any Change in favor of the game would be appreciated-----
